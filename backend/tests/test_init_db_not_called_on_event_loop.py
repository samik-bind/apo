"""``init_db`` must never be called directly from async code.

The migration ladder is ordinary synchronous code, and its v26 step drives an
``async`` placement helper with ``asyncio.run``. ``asyncio.run`` refuses to
start a loop when one is already running in the same thread, so calling
``init_db`` inline from an ``async def`` crashes with "asyncio.run() cannot be
called from a running event loop" — which is exactly what happened in
``lifespan``, taking down startup for every database upgrading through v26
with legacy deliverable blobs.

Async callers must hand it to a worker instead::

    await asyncio.to_thread(init_db)

This is a source-level guard rather than a behavioural one on purpose: driving
the real ``lifespan`` in-process starts the schedulers, retention loop, trace
ingestion worker, and lease reaper, which leak into the rest of the suite. The
rule being protected is structural, so the check is too — same approach as
``test_no_removed_execution_symbols``.
