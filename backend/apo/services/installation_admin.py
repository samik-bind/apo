"""Installation Administrator guard.

Extracts the private ``auth.py::_require_admin`` semantics into a shared
request-aware helper: only an authenticated, active ``UserDB.is_admin``
User may perform installation-level operations such as managing Hosted
Access Invitations.

Authority rules:

- **browser session** authority is accepted;
- **Project API keys** and executor capability credentials
  (``service_token`` / ``attempt_token``) are rejected even when their
  creator is an administrator — installation authority never rides on a
  Project-scoped credential;
- the guard never produces Project membership or Project access.
