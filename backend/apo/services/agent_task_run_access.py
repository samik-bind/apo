"""Reusable Task Run access authorization.

One helper owns the Project-derivation + own-service-token rule so every
Deliverable upload, download, lookup, and the touched Task Run detail/result
routes apply identical scoping. A content feature must not preserve
cross-Project lookup by globally opaque ID as an implicit authorization
strategy.

The Project is ALWAYS derived through ``AgentTaskBatchRunDB`` — never from
request JSON or query parameters.

- service or Attempt token: ``request.state.project`` must equal the batch
  Project and ``service_task_run_id`` must equal the Task Run ID;
- API key / dashboard cookie / open-dev: the canonical Project policy
  authorizes the caller against the batch Project. Non-member
  access is opaque (404) so an opaque ID does not reveal existence.
