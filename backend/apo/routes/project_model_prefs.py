"""Archiving models out of a project's filter dropdowns.

The model palette on the Runs and Tasks pages is derived from the distinct
``configured_model`` values on runs, so it only ever grows. This route lets any
project member retire a model from those lists, and put it back.

Archiving is shared across the project and display-only — see
``services/archived_models``. There is no GET here: the ``archived`` flag rides
the two existing facet payloads, so the dropdown needs no extra request.
